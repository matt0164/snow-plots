...Today in metro Denver weather history...

31-12 In 1899...a protracted cold spell lasted almost two weeks.
        Low temperatures plunged below zero on all days but
        February 9th with a reading of 6 degrees.  The coldest
        low temperature of 22 degrees below zero on February 6th
        was a record low for the date.  Low temperatures of 20
        degrees below zero occurred on both February 11th and 12th...
        but only the 11th remains as the record minimum for the
        date.  High temperature of only 5 degrees below zero on
        February 11th was a record low maximum for the date.  High
        temperatures climbed to only zero degrees on both February
        2nd and 3rd...but were not records.  Intermittent light snow
        or flurries fell during the period.  The most snowfall...2.0
        inches...occurred on February 2nd.
1-9   In 1883...a protracted cold period occurred when low
        temperatures dipped below zero for 9 consecutive days.
        Low temperatures ranged from 22 degrees below zero on
        the 4th to 2 degrees below zero on the 1st and 6th.  High
        temperatures ranged from 10 below zero on the 3rd to
        23 on the 9th.  Several temperature records were set
        that still stand today.  Record lows of 18 below and
        22 below zero occurred on the 3rd and 4th.  Record low
        maximum readings of 2 below and 10 below zero occurred on
        the 2nd and 3rd.  The high of only 10 below zero on the
        3rd is the coldest maximum temperature ever recorded in
        Denver.
5-11  In 1978...the 5th marked the start of a record 7 consecutive
        days of dense fog at Stapleton International Airport.  The
        heavy fog reduced the visibility to 1/4 mile or less for a
        period of time on each of these days.  Light snow and/or
        freezing drizzle occurred on most days.  Fog reducing
        visibility to less than 7 miles was recorded at Stapleton
        International Airport on 11 consecutive days through the
        15th.  During the period 5-14...the cold thick fog deposited
        heavy rime ice up to 5 inches thick on power lines and poles
        over a wide area of eastern Colorado...causing a major
        electrical power outage disaster.
6-10  In 1933...3:00 PM on the 6th marked the start of a protracted
        cold period through 8:00 AM on the 10th when the temperature
        was below zero for 86 out of 88 hours.  The cold period was
        interrupted on the 8th at 9:00 AM when the temperature was
        1 degree above zero and at 10:00 AM when the temperature was
        8 degrees above zero.  Four temperature records were set.
        High temperatures of 4 degrees below zero on the 7th...8
        degrees on the 8th...and 5 degrees below zero on the 9th were
        record low maximums for those dates.  The only record low
        temperature record was 14 degrees below zero on the 10th.
        The lowest temperature reached during the period was 16
        degrees below zero on both the 7th and 8th...which were not
        records.
8-9  In 1898...rain changed rapidly to snow during the late evening
        of the 8th and continued through the early afternoon of the
        9th.  Snowfall totaled 6.0 inches in the city.  Northeast
        winds were sustained to 26 mph with gusts to 30 mph on
        the 8th.
     In 2001...heavy snow fell across metro Denver mainly in and
        near the eastern foothills.  Snow totals included:  12 inches
        atop Crow Hill and near Evergreen; 10 inches in Evergreen and
        near Morrison; 9 inches at Genesee; 8 inches atop Lookout
        Mountain and near Littleton and Bailey; 6 inches at Arvada
        and Ken Caryl Ranch; and 5 inches in Broomfield...Chief Hosa...
        and Thornton.  Snowfall totaled 5.1 inches at the site of
        the former Stapleton International Airport.  Temperatures
        dipped to 15 degrees below zero at Denver International
        Airport on the morning of the 9th...setting a new record
        minimum for the date.
      In 2002...high winds in the foothills on the 8th spread over
        the plains on the 9th and caused much blowing dust and snow
        and blizzard conditions east and northeast of metro Denver.
        I-70 was closed from just east of Denver to the Kansas state
        line.  Zero visibilities coupled with snowpacked and slick
        roads caused multiple car accidents in southern Weld County.
        High winds developed in the foothills on the 8th with gusts
        to 71 mph on Rocky Flats and to 75 mph at the National Center
        for Atmospheric Research Mesa Lab in Boulder.  The high
        winds continued on the 9th with gusts to 83 mph near Fritz
        Peak...70 mph at Evergreen...and 67 mph at Parker.  Northwest
        winds gusted to 55 mph on the 8th and to 58 mph on the 9th at
        Denver International Airport where the surface visibility
        was reduced to as low as 1 mile in blowing dust on the 9th.
      In 2008...strong downslope winds developed in and near the
        Front Range Foothills.  Peak gusts included:  88 mph at
        Georgetown...85 mph at Berthoud Pass...81 mph at the NCAR
        Mesa Lab...78 mph at the National Wind Technology Center...
        at 76 mph at Floyd Hill.  At Denver International Airport...
        gusty west winds to 48 mph were observed on the 8th.
9     In 1886...north winds were sustained to 42 mph...the highest
        winds of the month that year.
      In 1893...northwest bora downslope winds were sustained to
        to 40 mph with gusts as high as 70 mph in the city.
      In 1960...the lowest pressure reduced to sea level ever
        recorded in Denver...28.83 inches (976.4 mb.)...occurred.
        The actual station pressure of 23.770 inches was also the
        lowest ever recorded.
      In 1967...northwest winds gusted to 51 mph at Stapleton
        International Airport.  Winds were strong and gusty all
        day.
      In 1988...high winds occurred in and near the foothills.
        Winds gusted to 96 mph in east Boulder.  As many as 1600
        homes lost power when wires were downed by the wind.
        Some windows were blown out of cars near Rocky Flats
        south of Boulder where winds were clocked at 85 mph.
        In Broomfield...winds were recorded to 68 mph at
        Jefferson County Airport.
      In 2009...high winds occurred in and near the foothills of
        Boulder and northern Jefferson Counties.  Peak wind gusts
        included 81 mph at the National Wind Technology Center
        and 6 miles northwest of Boulder.
9-10  In 1934...rain changed to heavy snow on the afternoon of
        the 9th and continued through the day on the 10th.
        Snowfall totaled 7.4 inches in downtown Denver.
        North winds were sustained to 24 mph on the 10th.
      In 1972...heavy post-frontal snowfall totaled 6.2 inches at
        Stapleton International Airport where northeast winds
        gusted to 46 mph on the 9th.  Temperatures plunged from
        a high of 51 degrees on the 9th to a low of 16 on the
        morning of the 10th.
      In 1981...the season`s coldest Arctic air mass rolled into
        metro Denver plunging temperatures from 10 below to 20
        degrees below zero.  Bitter north winds gusting as high
        as 36 mph sent wind chill temperatures to 50 below zero.
        Two to four inches of snow fell over metro Denver with
        6 to 12 inches in the foothills.  A Boulder man died
        of hypothermia while cross country skiing in the
        mountains west of the city.  Snowfall totaled only
        1.5 inches at Stapleton International Airport where the
        minimum temperature on the morning of the 10th was 5
        degrees below zero.  The temperature that day warmed to
        to a high of only 9 degrees.
      In 2003...high winds occurred in and near the eastern
        foothills.  The highest wind gusts recorded:  included
        80 mph atop Fritz Peak and 73 mph atop Blue Mountain and
        at the National Wind Technology Center on Rocky Flats
        south of Boulder.  At least 4 multi-car accidents
        occurred along State Highway 93...between Golden and
        Boulder when blowing snow caused whiteout conditions.
        Northwest winds gusted to 36 mph at Denver International
        Airport on the 10th.
      In 2017...hurricane force winds toppled trees and knocked
        over several semis in and near the Front Range Mountains
        and Foothills. Two trucks rolled over on I-70 in Georgetown.
        Downed power lines caused scattered electrical outages in
        Boulder County and impacted nearly four thousand residents.
        The temperature in Denver reached 80 degrees on the 10th. It
        was the first 80 degree temperature recorded in the month of
        February and established the all-time record for the month.
        The previous warmest temperature for any day in February was
        77 degrees on February 4...1890 and Feb. 28...2006. The high
        wind and extremely warm temperatures helped spread
        grassfires in Boulder Couunty.  No homes were damaged or
        lost. Intense wind gusts on the 10th also damaged to trees
        and fences and power lines across Boulder County. Blowing
        dirt reduced visibilities to a quarter-of-a-mile at times.
        A strong burst of wind uprooted trees...and knocked down an
        entire row of power poles and lines near Main Street and
        Pike Road in Longmont. The downed lines damaged a vehicle
        at one residence. Another resident had to be rescued when
        he was trapped in his car by downed electrical lines.
        Peak wind gusts included:  104 mph at Berthoud Pass...93 mph
        at Gold Hill...84 mph near Aspen Springs and Nederland...71
        mph in Firestone...62 mph in Windsor...59 mph at Denver
        International Airport...and 58 mph near Hoyt.
9-11  In 1965...heavy snowfall totaled 6.2 inches at Stapleton
        International Airport where northeast winds gusted to
        25 mph.
      In 1993...the same storm that dumped heavy snow in the
        mountains combined with an Arctic cold front to produce
        heavy snow across metro Denver.  Upslope snows of 4 to 8
        inches were common with some areas receiving nearly a foot.
        Ten inches of new snow were measured in Parker and 7 inches
        in southeast Denver.  At Stapleton International Airport...
        snowfall totaled 8.1 inches.  Strong winds combined with the
        snowfall to produce near-blizzard conditions over the
        plains closing many roads east of Denver.  North winds
        gusted to only 18 mph at Stapleton International Airport on
        the 9th.
